REDUX REDUX REDUX

The reducers from the react redux file, lies in the reducers folder which contains all the reducer
with the proper action(type and payload) and state(initial, and changed)


Connect is like a wrapper, it RETURNS A FUNCTION and then that functin wraps whatever component is there.
connect() // returns the higher order component(read more...)
connect () (componentName) the component returned WRAPS THE componentName.


mapStatetoprops(state) // here the state is the STATE OF THE STORE.
return {
	propName: state.(what property we want from the state)

}

// we are mapping

connect(mapStatetoprops) (A)

// the connect(map state to props) tells that we want all the properties returned from the map state to prop function from our 
redux store. 
this higher order component then wraps the component A and provides it with the required data	



// Always import the whole component, not in {} import x form y not import {x} from y else gadbad
//Always pass a constant in axios post (Refer to FirstPage ) , and DO NOT DIRECTLY pass an object.
